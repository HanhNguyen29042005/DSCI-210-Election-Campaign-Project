# Political Campaign Work
This experience is from DSCI 220â€”Data and Democracy. In this class, we were introduced to the local candidate campaigns running for the 2024 election year. Our group was assigned to the campaign of Connie Pillich, who is running for prosecutor in Hamilton County. We analyzed the data sets of registered voters and election results of previous elections to predict turnout and calculate the magic number. I used R-Studio to  do analysis and generate election maps to locate our base/ swing area.
